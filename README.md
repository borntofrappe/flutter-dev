# flutter-dev

When creating a new project with the Flutter extension for Visual Studio Code the resulting `README.md` document suggests a few links to get started developing Flutter applications:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)

- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

The [online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs) is also noted for additional material.

With this in mind the goal of this project is straightforward: go through the resources and create small applications to learn about the development kit.
