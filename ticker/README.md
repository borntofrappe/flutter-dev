[counter_app](https://github.com/borntofrappe/flutter-dev/tree/master/counter_app) creates a counter application focusing on a given layout. The goal of this project is to approach the feature with a different perspective, focusing on the animation of the digits as the count is updated.

The end result is an application which allows to count only positive values, scrolling the digits as the application is first initialized and with each button press.

## Going further

You can expand the application <!-- especially as you learn more about flutter --> in several ways, but as a first step consider adding a settings page to customize the application. Allow to change the number of digits, or again to tweak the animation, or again to avoid persisting state and start from zero every time the app is launched.
