# adding_interactivity

[The codelab](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/ui/interactive) follows on the footsteps of [building layouts](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/ui/layout/tutorial), a separate tutorial devoted to creating the layout after a given screenshot.

## Setup

I followed the codelab in a separate folder of this repository.

[From the separate folder](https://github.com/borntofrappe/flutter-dev/tree/master/building_layouts) copy-paste `main.dart`.

Also remember to add the image through the `pubspec.yaml` config file.

With this starting point the idea is to have the application interactive in the form of a custom widget for the number of times the page has been favorited. Tap the star icon to add or remove the location from the favorites, and in so doing modify the appearance of the icon and the accompanying counter.
